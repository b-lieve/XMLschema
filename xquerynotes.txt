return one node(most outside) at a time.
add ", $newline" at end of that node
could add "{$newline}";

use , to separate two "for" loop in parallel

////////////////////
This selects the parent of the current (context) node.
<node id="50>
  <childnode1 childid="51" />
  <childnode2 childid="52" />
</node>
Longer and more general answers:
//node()[childnode1/@childid="51"]
This selects any node in the document that has a child element named childnode1, that has an attibute childid, whose value is '51'.

One should try to avoid an expression that contains the // abbreviation, because this may be very inefficient. Use '//' only when the structure of the XML document isn't known in advance.

Best answer:
